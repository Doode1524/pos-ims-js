## Git Commands for submitting new code

- `git checkout main`
- `git pull` to pull down any new changes
- `git checkout -b branch-name` to make a new branch

Write any new code for an implementation in the new branch
When done:

- `git add .` to add all files, or
- `git add file-name` to add an individual file
- `git commit -m "descriptive-commit-message"` message is in quotes

If it is the first time you are pushing changes to the new branch:
- `git push --set-upstream origin branch-name`, else just run
- `git push`

Go into github and make the pull request once code is submitted
